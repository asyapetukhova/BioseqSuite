# Bioinformatics Homework Repository

This repository contains a collection of homework assignments and projects related to bioinformatics. The main purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for storing and organizing the code, data, and documentation associated with these assignments.

## Repository Contents

1. Homework Assignments: This repository includes various homework assignments covering a wide range of topics in bioinformatics. These assignments may involve coding exercises, data analysis tasks, algorithm implementations, or theoretical questions.

2. Python Scripts: The repository contains Python scripts and modules that implement various bioinformatics algorithms and functions. These scripts may include sequence analysis tools, phylogenetic tree construction, protein structure prediction, or any other relevant bioinformatics tasks.

3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Some of the assignments or projects in this repository may involve the implementation of bioinformatics algorithms or data structures using an object-oriented programming approach.

4. API Development: Certain assignments or projects may focus on the development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for bioinformatics applications or services.

5. Data Files and Examples: The repository may include sample data files, such as DNA sequences, protein structures, or other relevant data, that are used for testing or demonstrating the functionality of the implemented algorithms and tools.

Please note that this repository does not include the specific files mentioned (bio_files_processor.py and HW17) as those were likely part of a separate assignment or project not included in this particular repository.

The purpose of this README is to provide a high-level overview of the repository's contents and its general purpose. Detailed documentation for specific functions, classes, or modules should be found within the respective code files or accompanying documentation.
