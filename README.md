# BioseqSuite

This repository contains a collection of homework assignments and projects related to bioinformatics. The main purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for storing and organizing the code, data, and documentation associated with these assignments.

## Repository Contents

1. **Homework Assignments**: This repository includes various homework assignments covering a wide range of topics in bioinformatics, such as:
   - **BioseqSuite**: A module for working with biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences. It provides classes and methods for sequence manipulation, validation, and analysis.
   - **Random Forest Implementation**: A custom implementation of the Random Forest algorithm for machine learning tasks, with a focus on parallelizing the training and prediction processes for improved performance.

2. **Python Scripts**: The repository contains Python scripts and modules that implement various bioinformatics algorithms and functions.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Some of the assignments or projects in this repository involve the implementation of bioinformatics algorithms or data structures using an object-oriented programming approach.
   
4. **Parallel Programming**: The repository includes an assignment focused on parallel programming, specifically parallelizing the *Random Forest algorithm* for faster training and predictions.

5. **Tests**: The repository contains unit tests for validating the functionality of the implemented bioinformatics modules.

6. **Examples and Showcases**: The repository includes showcases demonstrating the usage and capabilities of the implemented bioinformatics tools.

Please note that this repository **does not include** the specific files mentioned (**bio_files_processor.py** and **HW17**).

Detailed documentation for specific functions, classes, or modules should be found within the respective code files or showcases.
